# LeetCode Tracker

This repository contains a **dynamic tracker tool** that I built to automatically update this `README.md` file with new problems . The tool simplifies the process of logging and documenting problems, solutions, and related metadata, such as difficulty and topics covered.

In addition to the tracker tool, this repository includes solutions to LeetCode problems and algorithm studies that I work on during my free time. 

Each problem is organized into its own folder under the `problems` package, and test cases are stored in the `tests` package. Below is a summary of the problems solved so far.



## Features
- **Dynamic Problem Addition**: You can use the `Leetcode2024.exe` program to add problems directly to the README table. Each time you run the executable, it prompts you for problem details and appends them to the table automatically.
- **Easy-to-Use Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The program is run from the command line or by double-clicking the `.exe` file, allowing you to enter problem details interactively.

## Usage Instructions

### Running the `Leetcode2024.exe` File
To dynamically add new Leetcode problems to the table:
1. **Download the `Leetcode2024.exe` file**:
   - You can find the `Leetcode2024.exe` in the [Releases section](#) of this repository.

2. **Ensure the `README.md` file is in the same directory**:
   - **Important Note**: The `README.md` file must be located in the same directory as the `Leetcode2024.exe` file for the program to update the table properly.

3. **Run the executable**:
   - You can run the program by either:
      - **Double-clicking** the `Leetcode2024.exe` file, or
      - Running it from the command line:
        ```bash
        ./Leetcode2024.exe
        ```

4. **Input problem details**:
   - After starting the program, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the following problem details:
      - Problem ID (from Leetcode)
      - Problem Name
      - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
      - Topics (comma-separated list)
      - Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
      - Notes

5. **Automatic Table Update**:
   - After entering the details, the problem will be automatically appended to the existing table in the `README.md` file.
   - You can then view the updated README with the new problem listed.
